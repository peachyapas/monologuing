# Hi

So I wanted to start this because I've always felt like there's this need to document everything, make a list of everything, and have them organised. My natural instinct is more or less to dump my brain's contents, which is usually just chaotic, but I also feel this need to have stuff organised so half the time I'm battling between trying to get all my thoughts down and trying to organise stuff properly.

Anyways. Yeah, I've named this monologue cause it's more or less just me stream-of-conscious dumping shit in here but hopefully, ORGANISED. Also I had no idea people usually don't have a list of everything in their life. Oops. I guess I'm psychotic enough to have a list of all the books I have on my shelf (371 and counting), and I have a master list of lists (a non-exhaustive lists of lists given I have some on my lists scribbled on 10 different notebooks and like, 10 different apps at this point).

Annnnd I just deployed this to GitHub pages which probably isn't a great idea because everyone can see it and tie it back to me (I don't want to pay $49/year to have a private repo) but I assume no one's interested enough in me to be reading this... so hi if you actually made it this far. I promise you, I'm normal (enough).


So here's the stuff I eventually want to have on this... brain dump page. Not sure if I'll even keep up with this but hereeee we go. 

Forewarning: this is pretty much JUST for me. I might have BAD recommendations cause it's tailored for ME. Do not trust my taste. I enjoy eating ***boiled*** bok chow. Straight up over-boiled soggy boy choy. And yes, I prefer it over the stir fried version.
