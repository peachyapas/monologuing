# hi


So I wanted to start this because I've always felt like there's this need to document everything, make a list of everything, and have them organised. My natural instinct is more or less to dump my brain's contents, which is usually just chaotic, but I also feel this need to have stuff organised so half of the time I'm battling between a stream of consciousness and trying to organise stuff properly.

Anyways. Yeah, I've named this monologue cause it's more or less just me stream-of-conscious dumping shit in here but ORGANISED. Also I had no idea people usually don't have a list of everything in their life. Oops.
